## DNC-DMS ?

> Streamline your production with DNC-DMS: Digitize, Network, and Control your machines.

In companies with a large number of employees, the flow of information is a major and essential asset to enable employees to not only be efficient, but also to have feedback on their actions. This issue also applies to the industrial robotic machines that Airbus uses to create the parts needed for assembling an airplane. In order to control the machines, Airbus employees use a document that they physically transfer to the machines via USB keys.
To optimize their work and simplify this process, Airbus has partnered with Sopra Steria to develop a network of all its machines and enable the transfer of this instruction document digitally. This is in [SAP](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_(entreprise)) [ERP](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progiciel_de_gestion_int%C3%A9gr%C3%A9), specifically the DNS-DMS project.
Since the agents are physically absent from the machines, they need to be informed by an alert when there is a change in status of one of the machines they manage.

### How It Works

The DNC-DMS project aims to network all of Airbus' industrial robots to allow for the transfer of instructions digitally. This enables the employees to control the machines remotely, and simplifies the transfer of instructions.

### My Role as a Junior Developer

As a [ABAP](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP#:~:text=ABAP%20est%20un%20langage%20de,pour%20la%20r%C3%A9alisation%20de%20progiciels.) junior developer on the project, I was responsible for developing the email notification procedure. This involved working closely with the project team and understanding the requirements of the end users.

I used my skills in programming languages such as ABAP and SQL to design and implement the procedure. I also collaborated with the team to ensure that the procedure was integrated into the project seamlessly and met the user's needs.

Overall, my role on the DNC-DMS project allowed me to gain valuable experience in developing procedures for industrial automation, working with a team, and communicating with end users.

#### Key Features

- Centralized Machine Control: DNC-DMS provides a centralized system for controlling all the machines in the production process, allowing for better coordination and monitoring of production.
- Digital Document Transfer: The software enables digital transfer of documents and instructions to the machines, eliminating the need for manual transfer via USBs and reducing the risk of errors and delays.
- Real-time Machine Monitoring: DNC-DMS allows for real-time monitoring of machine status, providing alerts to operators and supervisors when machines require attention or maintenance.
- Automated Communication: The system can automatically generate and send email alerts to relevant personnel when a machine's status changes, enabling efficient and timely response to issues or delays.
- Data Analytics: DNC-DMS captures data on machine performance, downtime, and efficiency, enabling managers to identify areas for improvement and optimize the production process.
