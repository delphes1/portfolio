## Where are you ?

> Track parts, optimize your supply chain with W@Y.

Way is an application developed for Airbus to track aircraft parts around the world. The goal of this application is to provide a real-time map of the location of different parts, enabling key performance indicators (KPI) tracking, parts management, and forecasting of their arrival and departure.

### How It Works

The Way application provides a real-time map that shows the location of different aircraft parts as they are being transported across the world. The map updates automatically as the parts move, allowing for accurate tracking of their location and status.

Each part is tagged with a unique identification number, which is used to track its movements across different locations.

### My Role as a Full-Stack Developer

The development of W@Y was a team effort, and I was fortunate to be a part of the project as a full-stack developer, responsible for both the frontend and backend development.

My role in the project was to work closely with the rest of the team to ensure that the application was developed to the highest standards. I was responsible for implementing the frontend design of the application, as well as developing the backend infrastructure that powered the application.

Working on this project was an exciting and challenging experience, and I was proud to be a part of the team that developed such a powerful and innovative application.

#### Key Features

- Real-time tracking: Way provides a real-time map of the location of different aircraft parts as they move across the world.
- KPI tracking: The application provides key performance indicators (KPIs) that enable users to track the performance of different parts and make informed decisions based on this data.
- Parts management: Users can use Way to manage different aircraft parts, including tracking their location, managing their movement, and forecasting their arrival and departure.

Way is a powerful application developed for Airbus that enables real-time tracking of aircraft parts around the world. With its advanced tracking features and powerful data analytics capabilities, Way offers a number of benefits to its users, including improved supply chain management, greater transparency, and improved decision-making.
